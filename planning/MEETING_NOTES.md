## Session Log

### 2026-02-11 — Overnight Session Part 2: Loading Screens, Waiver Bot, Filing Cabinet

Continuation of overnight session after context ran out. Completed remaining tasks from the 7-area overnight spec.

**Loading Screen Customization (ALL experiences):**
- Added tagline cycling infrastructure to `setup.js` — `_startSetupTaglineCycle()` / `_stopSetupTaglineCycle()` with 2.5s interval and fade transitions
- Default taglines for slides/pack-opening/arcade: "Analyzing 1,000+ roster decisions...", "Calculating your biggest mistakes...", etc.
- Page-specific overrides via `window.SETUP_TAGLINES` set before `setup.js` loads:
  - Pack Opening: card-themed ("Shuffling the deck...", "Minting holographic cards...")
  - Arcade: ALL CAPS retro ("INSERTING QUARTERS...", "WARMING UP THE CRT...")
- Enhanced existing tagline arrays for Mario (+7), Madden (+6), Pokemon (+7)
- Updated `slides.html`, `pack-opening.html`, `arcade.html` with `id="setupLoadingTagline"` on step4 `<p>` tags

**NEW: Waiver Bot Experience (full build):**
- **Backend:** `backend/stats/waiver_analyzer.py` — Derives transactions from week-over-week roster diffs (ESPN doesn't expose transaction history for public leagues). Computes 7 awards: Journeyman, Waiver Hawk, Diamond in the Rough, Tinkerer, Set and Forget, Revolving Door, Graveyard, plus Flipped count
- **API:** `/api/league/<id>/waivers` endpoint with year, start_week, end_week params
- **Frontend:** `frontend/waiver.html` + `waiver.css` + `waiverController.js` — Dark theme, 4 tabs (Awards, By Week, By Team, All Transactions), type-colored badges (ADD/DROP/TRADE), team cards with top pickups
- Added to hub page (`index.html`)

**NEW: Filing Cabinet Experience (full build):**
- **Frontend:** `frontend/filing-cabinet.html` + `filing-cabinet.css` + `filingCabinetController.js`
- Detective/office aesthetic: wood desk, metal cabinet drawer, manila folder tabs, paper pages with red margin lines, paperclip decoration, typewriter font
- Uses weekly deep-dive API (`/api/league/<id>/week/<week>/deep-dive`) — same backend as Weekly Deep Dive
- Folder tabs show W/L and scores per week; clicking opens manila folder overlay with matchup report, lineups, bench, standings, other matchups
- Added `/filing-cabinet.html` route to `app.py` and hub page entry

### 2026-02-11 — Draft Board V2: Major Feature Overhaul

- **5-star grading system:** Replaced simple GEM/BUST with 0.5-5.0 star scale. Formula factors: expected value by round, positional ranking, BYE-adjusted start %, dropped penalty. Stars displayed as filled/half/empty star characters with GEM/BUST labels on extremes only (5.0 and 1.0).
- **BYE week adjustment:** Start % and avg points now account for player BYE weeks. Detects BYEs by checking weeks where player scored 0 and was not started by any team, or was absent but rostered in adjacent weeks.
- **League draft grades (A+ to F):** Each team graded on composite: 50% total points (normalized), 30% avg stars, 20% gem-bust ratio. Displayed in summary cards and team modal.
- **Position group grades:** Each team graded per position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, D/ST) relative to league averages. Displayed in modal as grid of grade cards.
- **Clickable team roster modals:** Click any team name in the table to open a modal with: draft grade, LLM synopsis, best/worst pick highlights, position group grades grid, full pick list with star ratings. Close via X button, click-outside, or Escape key.
- **Visual round separators:** When sorted by pick order (default), styled separator rows ("-- Round 2 --") appear between rounds with amber accent styling.
- **LLM draft synopses:** 2-sentence AI-generated analysis per team highlighting best/worst picks. Uses Claude API with file-based caching. Falls back to template text when API unavailable.
- **Poacher detection:** Tracks which managers picked up 2+ players originally drafted by the same other manager. Data included in API response.
- **Sticky header fix:** Replaced hardcoded `top: 80px` with CSS variable `--draft-header-height` that JS measures and sets dynamically after render. Header padding reduced from 20px to 16px.
- **Grade column sortable:** Stars column now sortable in the table header.
- **Summary cards updated:** New "Your Draft Grade" card with large amber letter grade. Best value and worst pick cards now show star ratings.
- **Files modified:**
  - `backend/stats/draft_analyzer.py` — Major rewrite: BYE detection, star grading, team grades, position grades, poacher detection, LLM synopses with caching
  - `backend/app.py` — Draft endpoint returns new fields: team_grades, position_grades, poachers, team_synopses
  - `frontend/static/js/draftController.js` — Major rewrite: star rendering, round separators, team modal, dynamic header measurement, new state fields
  - `frontend/static/css/draft.css` — Added: star ratings, round separators, team modal with all sub-components, grade-card style, team-link clickable style, CSS variable for header height
  - `frontend/draft.html` — Grade column now sortable

### 2026-02-11 — Mario World: Sprint Mechanic + Wii-era Realism Overhaul

- **Sprint mechanic:** Hold Space bar to sprint at 3.5x speed (normal: 1.5). Emits dust particles behind Toad while running, bigger/more frequent dust clouds when sprinting. isSprinting state tracked in controller.
- **Particle system:** Full particle engine with 4 types: dust clouds (walking/sprinting), sparkles (near location buildings), falling leaves (from trees), and water ripples (at shorelines). Particles have physics (velocity, gravity/sway), alpha fade-out, and are capped at 200 for performance.
- **Depth sorting:** All drawable objects (trees, buildings, NPCs, player, butterflies, dandelion seeds) are Y-sorted each frame so Toad properly walks behind/in front of objects. Replaced flat layer-by-layer rendering with unified depth-sorted draw pass.
- **Parallax mountains:** Distant mountain/hill silhouette layer behind clouds, scrolls at 0.5x camera speed. Taller mountains have pixel-art snow caps. Adds real depth to the scene.
- **Tree shadows:** All trees and bushes now cast dark ellipse ground shadows beneath them. Palm tree fronds now sway with 4 independent organic phases per tree (front/back/left/right fronds move differently). Added trunk segmentation detail and drooping frond tips.
- **Ambient creatures:** 3-5 butterflies flutter around randomly with wing-flap animation and direction changes. 8 dandelion seeds drift across the map with gentle sway. Both are depth-sorted with world objects.
- **Improved water:** Animated shimmer/reflection highlights move across water surfaces. Foam lines appear at water-to-land tile boundaries with gentle wave motion.
- **Atmospheric lighting:** Screen-space vignette (radial gradient darker at edges). Subtle blue tint around water tiles. Warm orange glow around lava tiles.
- **Building improvements:** All location buildings now have ground shadows. Sparkle particles emit near buildings periodically.
- **Files modified:**
  - `frontend/static/js/marioController.js` — Sprint mechanic (Space key tracking, speed toggle, dust particle emission)
  - `frontend/static/js/marioRenderer.js` — Major additions: particle system, depth sorting, parallax mountains, ambient creatures, water effects, atmospheric lighting, tree shadows, improved palm trees (grew from 1660 to 2383 lines)

Auto-plays attacks using actual starter performances as "moves" (SPLASH for <5 pts, HYPER BEAM for 30+). HP bars animate down. Shake effect on hit. Shows win/loss result with actual scores. Press ENTER after battle to see full stats overlay.
- **Gameboy Color palette:** Entire rendering switched to authentic blue-tint 4-color palette (#C4D8F8, #6890B8, #305878, #081820) with green alternate for grass areas (#88C070, #346856). All tiles, sprites, text boxes, battle screen use this palette.

- **Method:** Direct API calls against real league data (league 17810260, 2024 season) to map every view parameter, data structure, and field.
- **Findings documented:** Created `dev/specs/006-espn-api-research.md` with:
  - 16+ API views cataloged with their returned data
  - Full draft data structure (picks, keepers, auction bids, auto-draft detection)
  - Player projections vs actuals (statSourceId 0 vs 1)
  - Scoring stat ID reference table (45+ stat categories)
  - Keeper value data, positional strength-of-schedule ratings
  - Transaction counter data per team (acquisitions, drops, trades, IR moves, FAAB)
  - Historical season access (all past years accessible)
  - Playoff bracket reconstruction from playoffTierType
  - 27 creative stat ideas for Wrapped, prioritized by effort level
- **Key discoveries:** Draft data (`mDraftDetail`), player projections (`mBoxscore` statSourceId=1), draftDayProjectedRank vs actual rank, cumulative score by stat category, division/home/away records, keeper values, and positional ratings are all freely available without auth.
- **Limitation:** Individual transaction history (specific add/drop/trade details) requires authentication cookies. Only aggregate counts are public.

### 2026-02-10 — Overnight Session: Weekly Deep Dive V2 (Items 1-7)

**What was shipped (7 of 9 items):**

- **Item 1: Roster Spacing Bug Fix** — Fixed weird vertical gap above players with red `!` triangle. Root cause: error indicator had `display: inline-block` + `font-size: 16px` causing extra height. Changed to `display: inline-flex`, `font-size: 13px`, `line-height: 1`. Also reduced `.player-list` gap from 8px to 4px.
- **Item 2: Starters vs Bench Visual Distinction** — Starters get subtle white background tint. Bench section gets dashed border-top separator, dimmed opacity (0.75), and muted point colors. Section labels "Starters" and "Bench" added.
- **Item 3: Top Scorers Scrolling Ticker** — New horizontally-scrolling ticker showing top 3 fantasy scorers at each position (QB → RB → WR → TE → K → D/ST). Each card shows ESPN headshot, score, player name, and fantasy team. Uses same infinite scroll animation pattern as NFL scores ticker. Async headshot loading with placeholders.
- **Item 4: Headshots in League Matchups** — Replaced UI Avatars initial circles with real ESPN player headshots for top 3 scorers in matchup cards. Uses async `getPlayerHeadshot()` with graceful fallback to placeholder images.
- **Item 5: Team Selection Required** — New team selection screen shown before deep dive. Users pick their team from a grid of team cards. Selection stored in URL params. Works with both `teamId` and `team` (name) URL params.
- **Item 6: Better Loading Screen** — Replaced static loading text with cycling football-themed taglines (14 messages). Added spinning football emoji animation. Smooth fade transitions between taglines every 2.5 seconds.
- **Item 7: Improved Week Selector** — Week buttons now show "Week N" label + score/W-L/score. Active week visually larger (scale 1.08). W = green, L = red. Pre-fetches all week results in background for progressive nav updates.

**Files modified:**
- `frontend/static/css/weekly.css` — All CSS for items 1-7
- `frontend/static/js/weeklyRenderer.js` — Starters/bench classes, headshot loading, top scorers ticker
- `frontend/static/js/weeklyController.js` — Complete rewrite: team selection, loading taglines, W/L week nav

---

### 2026-02-10 — Weekly Deep Dive Improvements Batch (Overnight)

**What was shipped:**

- **Number Precision** — Added `formatPts()` helper in `weeklyRenderer.js`. All fantasy point displays now use `.toFixed(1)`. NFL integer scores untouched.
- **Roster Display Order** — Added `sortRoster()` method. Starters sorted: QB → RB → RB → WR → WR → TE → FLEX → D/ST → K. Bench sorted by points descending.
- **Clickable Matchups** — Matchup cards in "All Matchups" section now expand inline on click to show full rosters for both teams. Lazy-renders on first click. Includes collapse/expand toggle.
  - **Bonus: Top 3 Scorers** — Each team in matchup cards shows headshot avatars of top 3 scorers (UI Avatars)
  - **Bonus: Lost Points** — Red "-X.X" lost points shown next to team scores in matchup cards
- **Standings Enhancements (Backend)** — Rewrote `calculate_standings_through_week()` in `weekly_analyzer.py`:
  - Now calculates optimal lineups for ALL teams ALL weeks (not just the user's team)
  - Tracks cumulative errors, lost_points, and perfect_weeks per team
  - Computes previous week rankings for rank_change calculation
- **Standings Enhancements (Frontend)** — Enhanced standings table:
  - New columns: Errors (orange), Lost Pts (red), Perfect (gold stars)
  - Rank change indicators: green ▲+N / red ▼-N arrows
  - All 7 columns sortable by clicking headers (ascending/descending toggle)
- **NFL Team Logos** — Team logos from ESPN CDN (`a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/`) next to abbreviations in scores section
- **NFL Scores Redesign** — Completely new layout:
  - Horizontal ticker with auto-scroll animation (60s loop, duplicated cards for seamless scroll)

  - Pauses on hover, manual horizontal scroll enabled

**Files modified:**
- `frontend/static/js/weeklyRenderer.js` — All 7 features
- `frontend/static/css/weekly.css` — New styles for standings, matchups, NFL scores
- `backend/stats/weekly_analyzer.py` — Enhanced standings with errors/lost_points/perfect_weeks/rank_change

**Tested:** API verified with League 17810260, Year 2025. Standings data correct across weeks 1-8. Rank changes verified between weeks. Perfect weeks and error counts accumulate correctly.

**Note:** AI summaries (objective 1) skipped per user request — user handling ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Railway env var separately.

**Key decision:** Player headshots use UI Avatars (initials) rather than ESPN headshots, since ESPN headshots require player IDs we don't have in the data flow. Reliable fallback that always works.

---

### 2026-02-09 — Railway Fix, Process Improvements, Permissions

**What happened:**
- **Fixed Railway production crash** — `anthropic` and `python-dotenv` were in `backend/requirements.txt` but NOT root `requirements.txt`. Railway only reads root. App crashed on import at startup. Both files now synced.
- **Broadened permissions** in `.claude/settings.local.json` — added common dev commands (`nohup`, `lsof`, `kill`, `sleep`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, etc.) plus all skills. Overnight sessions were halting on permission prompts for basic commands.
- **Updated `/overnight` skill** with:
  - "Test As You Build" section — test every feature locally before moving on, fix bugs immediately, don't batch testing
  - Senior review runs at end of consolidation phase
  - Deployment readiness checks (root requirements.txt, env vars)
  - Updated completion checklist
- **Updated CLAUDE.md** with:
  - Deployment gotchas section (root vs backend requirements.txt, env vars)
  - New common issues (Railway crash, LLM fallback, NFL scores empty)

**Key decision:** Permissions are now broad enough for fully autonomous overnight sessions. All common bash commands and all skills are pre-approved.

### 2026-02-09 — LLM Summaries Working End-to-End

**What happened:**
- **Fixed NFL scores not loading** — ESPN's `season`/`seasontype` params return 0 events for historical data. Switched `nfl_data.py` to use `dates` param with Labor Day-anchored week calculation. Now returns all 16 games per week.
- **Tested full summary pipeline** — NFL + Fantasy summaries generating via Claude API (Sonnet 4.5). Both cached to disk for instant reloads.
- **Added $5 API credits** — previous key had zero balance, causing silent fallback. Now funded and working.
- **Improved error handling in `summary_generator.py`**:
  - API errors now classified (billing, auth, rate limit, server down, timeout)
  - Clear `[Summaries]` log lines at startup and on errors
  - Fallback text tells you *why* summaries aren't loading (e.g. "API credits exhausted" vs "invalid key" vs "not configured")
  - Imported `APIStatusError` from anthropic for proper error classification

**Key files changed:**
- `backend/nfl_data.py` — date-based ESPN API query, Labor Day anchor for week calculation
- `backend/summary_generator.py` — error classification, descriptive fallbacks, startup logging

---

### 2026-02-09 — LLM Summary Integration Setup & ESPN API Research

**What happened:**
- Set up Anthropic API key for Claude-generated NFL and fantasy summaries
  - Created `backend/.env` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - Already in `.gitignore`, secure from git commits
- Researched ESPN Fantasy API to understand available data for rich summaries
  - **Found:** `mPendingTransactions` view exposes waiver wire activity
  - **Found:** `injuryStatus` field in player data (detect injured players in lineups)
  - **Found:** Additional views: `mBoxScore`, `mDraftDetail`, `mLiveScoring`, `mPositionalRatings`
  - **Limitations:** No NFL play-by-play, no pre-game odds (can't detect "upsets" technically)
- Updated `dev/specs/001-weekly-deep-dive.md` with:
  - Implementation decisions (API key storage, caching strategy, generation approach)
  - ESPN API data availability research findings
  - Content strategy for NFL and fantasy summaries based on available data
  - Resolved open questions section

**Ready for implementation:**
- API key configured and secure
- Data sources documented
- Clear content strategy for what summaries should include
- Next: `/overnight` to build `summary_generator.py` and integrate LLM summaries

**Overnight session scope confirmed:**
- Build backend: `summary_generator.py`, `nfl_data.py`, update `weekly_analyzer.py`
- Implement ESPN API extensions: `mPendingTransactions` (waiver wire), `injuryStatus` (injuries)
- Add NFL Scores section (Section 4) - data already pulled for summaries
- File-based caching with force-regenerate capability
- Full frontend integration: add summary sections to `weekly.html`, rendering functions
- Test with league 17810260, year 2025, team "Will"
- **Deferred:** Lineup editor (tap-to-swap) - placeholder exists, implement later

**LLM summary implementation completed:**
- Built `backend/nfl_data.py` - ESPN NFL scoreboard API integration
- Built `backend/summary_generator.py` - Claude API integration with file-based caching
- Enhanced `backend/stats/weekly_analyzer.py` with summary generation
- Updated weekly deep dive API endpoint to include summaries and NFL scores
- Added frontend rendering in `weekly.html` (NFL summary, fantasy summary, NFL scores grid)
- Cache directory: `backend/cache/summaries/` (auto-created, in `.gitignore`)
- API supports `include_summaries=true/false` and `force_regenerate=true/false` params
- **Documentation updated:** CLAUDE.md now includes new files, API changes, and external dependencies

---

### 2026-02-09 — File System Reorganization

**What happened:**
- Reorganized project to clearly separate app code from planning/strategy docs
- Created `planning/` folder for business & strategy (MEETING_NOTES.md, ROADMAP.md, stand-ups/, references/, design-specs/)
- Created `dev/` folder for development artifacts (specs/, test-reports/, overnight-summaries/, bug-reports/)
- Moved all files to new locations
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new folder structure and paths
- Updated all skill SKILL.md files with new paths (.claude/skills/*)

**New structure:**
```
├── backend/              # App code
├── frontend/             # App code
├── planning/             # Business & strategy
│   ├── MEETING_NOTES.md
│   ├── ROADMAP.md
│   ├── stand-ups/
│   ├── references/
│   └── design-specs/
└── dev/                  # Development process
    ├── specs/
    ├── test-reports/
    ├── overnight-summaries/
    └── bug-reports/
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual separation: app code vs planning vs dev artifacts
- Easier to navigate: "where's the strategy stuff?" → planning/
- Cleaner root directory
- Future-proof for scaling documentation

### 2026-02-09 — Advanced Stats Package Ideation, Spec & Consolidation

**What happened:**
- User requested ideation on emotionally powerful, shareable stats
- Brainstormed 50+ stat ideas organized by emotional impact and shareability
- Created comprehensive spec doc: `spec-docs/003-advanced-stats-package.md`
- Consolidated overlapping ROADMAP items into the spec (merged duplicates)
- Restructured ROADMAP priorities to reference spec phases (1/2/3)

**Stat categories explored:**
- **Decision Patterns** — When/why you make mistakes (Sunday panic, consistency vs chaos, clutch gene)
- **Positional Intelligence** — Error rates by position, FLEX graveyard, depth IQ
- **Risk Analysis** — Ceiling chasers vs floor seekers, injury risk tolerance
- **League Context** — Strength of schedule, nemesis/victim, unluckiest losses
- **Timing & Momentum** — Streaks, peak windows, early vs late season
- **Anomaly Detection** — Goose eggs, bench explosions, extreme margins
- **Would've/Could've/Should've** — Perfect season record, one-player-away games, cost of errors
- **Manager Archetypes** — The Gambler, The Tinkerer, The Lucky Bastard, etc.

**Top 15 priority stats identified:**
1. Close game record (clutch or choke?)
2. Position error breakdown
3. Strength of schedule
4. Nemesis/victim (head-to-head)
5. Longest win/loss streaks
6. Bench explosion week
7. Goose egg count
8. One-player-away count
9. Perfect season record
10. Volatility ranking
11. Draft vs waiver MVP
12. Projection deviation
13. Manager archetype classification
14. Nail-biters count (<3pt games)
15. Boom-bust ratio

**Spec details:**
- Organized into 3 tiers by implementation complexity
- **Tier 1 (Quick Wins):** 16 stats using existing data — consistency, position errors, clutch factor, bench narratives, extreme margins, perfect season analysis
- **Tier 2 (Medium Effort):** Head-to-head matrix, positional depth, roster tenure, season splits, archetype classification
- **Tier 3 (Complex):** Draft/acquisition analysis, injury tracking, projection comparison (requires new ESPN API data)
- MVP scope: Phase 1 only (Tier 1 stats) = 3-4 new slides, ~16 stats, 1 overnight session
- Implementation plan includes backend module updates and new `advanced_analyzer.py`

**Consolidation changes:**
- Removed duplicate items from ROADMAP P0/P1/P2 now covered in spec
- ROADMAP P0 → Advanced Stats Package Phase 1 (Tier 1 quick wins)
- ROADMAP P1 → Advanced Stats Package Phase 2 (Tier 2 medium effort)
- ROADMAP P2 → Advanced Stats Package Phase 3 (Tier 3 complex)
- Added note to "Later" section pointing to spec for consolidated items
- Added "Top Heavy" stat to spec Tier 2 (wasn't originally included)

**Items consolidated:**
- Luckiest Win / Heartbreaking Loss → Spec Tier 1
- FLEX Analysis → Spec Tier 1 (FLEX Graveyard)
- Week-by-Week Error Chart → Spec Tier 1 (consistency metrics)
- Free Agent / Draft Analysis → Spec Tier 3
- Position Depth Analysis → Spec Tier 2
- Bye Week Heroes → Spec Tier 2
- Head-to-head rivalry → Spec Tier 2
- Trade analysis → Spec Tier 3
- Injury impact → Spec Tier 3
- Home Grown Talent → Spec Tier 3
- Good Calls vs Projections → Spec Tier 3

**Files created:**
- `spec-docs/003-advanced-stats-package.md`

**Files modified:**
- `ROADMAP.md` — Consolidated duplicate stat items, restructured priorities by spec phases, updated "Ideas" section
- `spec-docs/003-advanced-stats-package.md` — Added missing stats: "Top Heavy" (Tier 2), "Week-by-Week Error Tracking" (Tier 1), "Crown Jewel" (Tier 2), "Practice Squad" (Tier 3), added consolidation notes

**Verification pass:**
- Systematically checked all ROADMAP items are captured in spec
- Added 4 missing stats to ensure complete coverage
- Updated consolidation notes with all items

**Key design principle:**
"Every stat should answer: Does this make me want to screenshot and roast my friends? If not, cut it."

**Next steps (when prioritized):**
1. Implement Tier 1 stats (Phase 1)
2. Test with league 17810260, validate accuracy
3. Design/implement new slide layouts
4. Integrate into card pack experience
5. Phase 2/3 after MVP ships

### 2026-02-09 — CLAUDE.md Updated: Parallelism & Subagent Usage

**What happened:**
- Added comprehensive "Parallelism & Subagent Usage" section to CLAUDE.md
- New guidance encourages aggressive use of subagents and parallel exploration
- Includes concrete examples, patterns, and rules of thumb

**Key additions:**
- **When to use subagents**: Codebase exploration, multi-part investigations, background tasks, complex research
- **Parallelism patterns**: Parallel exploration (3+ Explore agents), background delegation, parallel file modifications
- **Available agent types**: Explore, general-purpose, Bash, Plan (with usage examples)
- **Project-specific examples**: Pack opening animation analysis, new experience development, bug investigation
- **Rules of thumb**: >2 files = parallel agents, complex questions = multiple subsystem agents, default to parallelization

**Files modified:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added 150-line section after "Working Together", before "Personal Preferences"

**Rationale:**
- User observed hype about parallel Claude instances but wasn't sure how to optimize usage
- Subagents enable 3-5x speedup for exploration/investigation tasks
- Future Claude instances will now default to aggressive parallelism instead of sequential work

---

### 2026-02-09 — Arcade Visual Realism Spec Created

**What happened:**
- Created spec doc for arcade cabinet visual realism overhaul (`spec-docs/002-arcade-visual-realism.md`)
- Spec defines "super realistic" 3D arcade cabinet with authentic materials, textures, and depth
- Marked as backlog item — requires design ideation session before implementation

**Key details:**
- Target: Photorealistic arcade cabinet using CSS, pseudo-elements, gradients, shadows
- Enhancements: 3D perspective with visible side panels, wood grain textures, metallic screen housing, authentic control panel, T-molding, speaker grilles, wear/scuff marks
- Open questions flagged: Exact 3D angle, wood grain placement, color palette, marquee design, reference cabinet
- Out of scope: No functional changes, purely visual polish

**Files created:**
- `spec-docs/002-arcade-visual-realism.md`

**Files modified:**
- `ROADMAP.md` — Added arcade visual realism to "Polish & UX" backlog section

**Priority:** Backlog — "Someday make it perfect" polish pass, not urgent for launch

---

### 2026-02-09 — Arcade Cabinet Sizing Bug Fix

**What happened:**
- Fixed arcade cabinet cutoff bug on 14" MacBooks (bug-reports/003-arcade-cabinet-cutoff-macbook.md)
- Implemented Option A (Dynamic Height Scaling) from bug report
- Added responsive media queries for smaller laptop screens

**Bug:** Arcade cabinet was 90vh with max-height 850px, causing bottom control panel to be cut off on 14" MacBooks (~900px viewport height)

**Fix implemented:**
- Changed `.arcade-cabinet` height to `min(90vh, 750px)` with max-height 750px
- Added `@media (max-height: 900px)` breakpoint: 85vh / 750px max
- Added `@media (max-height: 800px)` breakpoint: 80vh / 650px max

**Files modified:**
- `frontend/static/css/arcade.css` — lines 62-70, added responsive breakpoints

**Result:** Cabinet now fits properly on 13", 14", 15", 16" laptop screens without requiring scrolling

---

### 2026-02-09 — Senior Review Session

**What happened:**
- User requested `/senior-review` on current codebase
- Completed autonomous full-codebase audit (all backend, frontend, docs)
- Found and fixed 3 bugs, 2 quality improvements
- Committed changes with descriptive commit message
- User reminded: **Always update meeting notes every conversation** (don't wait until end of session)

**Scope:** Full codebase — backend + frontend + documentation

**Bugs found and fixed:**
- [backend/app.py:36-39] Dead code route `/v2` referenced non-existent `index-v2.html` file from old architecture → Removed route entirely
- [frontend/static/js/setup.js:199-202] Obsolete code checking for `currentExperienceMode` variable and calling `PackOpening.start()` from legacy architecture → Removed conditional, simplified to direct slideshow initialization
- [frontend/static/js/weeklyController.js:132] Using raw `fetch()` instead of `apiFetch()` wrapper → Switched to `apiFetch()` for consistent error handling with descriptive messages

**Code quality improvements:**
- [ROADMAP.md] Updated Card Pack Experience reference from non-existent `index-v2.html` to correct `pack-opening.html`

**Documentation updates:**
- None needed — CLAUDE.md project structure accurately reflects reality

**Overall assessment:**
Codebase is in excellent shape. No critical bugs, no security issues, no performance problems. The multi-experience architecture (slides, cards, arcade, weekly, VR) is well-organized with clear separation of concerns. Error handling is comprehensive (especially the `apiFetch` wrapper with descriptive error messages). Only issues found were minor remnants from architectural evolution (dead code referencing old file names).

**Recommended follow-ups:**
- None — codebase is production-ready

---

### 2026-02-09 — Test Skill Creation & Skill Usage Guidelines

- Created `/test` skill for end-to-end QA validation
- Updated `/overnight` skill to recommend `/test` after shipping frontend changes
- Added "When to Use Each Skill" section to CLAUDE.md with:
  - Situation-based skill selection guide
  - Common skill chains (workflows)
  - Skill usage rules
- Updated CLAUDE.md project structure to include `test-reports/` directory
- Updated "When to Read What" table to include test reports

**What was shipped:**
- ✅ `.claude/skills/test/SKILL.md` — new skill for manual browser testing + API validation
- ✅ `test-reports/.gitkeep` — directory for numbered test reports
- ✅ Updated `.claude/skills/overnight/SKILL.md` — added frontend testing reminder
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` — project structure, custom skills table, "When to Use Each Skill" section

**Key decisions:**
- Test skill is semi-automated: API tests run via curl, browser tests via guided checklist with user confirmation
- Test reports numbered like other docs: `001-YYYY-MM-DD-scope.md`
- Test skill validates against spec docs when they exist
- Overnight must recommend `/test` if frontend code shipped

**How to use `/test`:**
1. Run after `/overnight` ships frontend changes
2. Run before considering a feature "done"
3. Run before showing features to others
4. Run to validate against spec requirements
5. Can test specific feature, specific page, or full regression

**Next steps (as requested by user):**
1. Run `/senior-review` on current codebase
2. Run `/test` on Weekly Deep Dive

---

### 2026-02-09 — Weekly Deep Dive Implementation (Overnight Session)

- Built core Weekly Deep Dive feature from `spec-docs/001-weekly-deep-dive.md`
- Implemented backend weekly analyzer + API endpoint
- Implemented frontend week navigation + matchup detail + standings
- Wired into hub page as 4th experience option
- Tested end-to-end with league 17810260, year 2025, team Will Hofner

**What was shipped:**
- ✅ Backend: `weekly_analyzer.py` — per-week analysis (matchups, rosters, standings, lineup errors)
- ✅ API endpoint: `/api/league/<id>/week/<week>/deep-dive` (requires `team_id` param)
- ✅ Frontend: `weekly.html` — week navigation, matchup detail, standings, all matchups list
- ✅ JS modules: `weeklyController.js` (data fetching, week nav), `weeklyRenderer.js` (DOM rendering)
- ✅ Stub: `lineupEditor.js` (placeholder for tap-to-swap functionality)
- ✅ CSS: `weekly.css` — magazine layout, responsive, dark theme
- ✅ Hub integration: added "Weekly Deep Dive" option to experience picker (4th card, 2x2 grid)

**Deferred to later:**
- Tap-to-swap lineup editor (stub created, not implemented)
- Projected points parsing from ESPN API
- NFL scores (Section 4 — `nfl_data.py` + ESPN scoreboard API)
- LLM-generated summaries (Sections 1 & 2B — Claude API integration)
- Expandable matchup cards in "All Matchups" section

**Key decisions:**
- Team selection: If no `team` or `teamId` param in URL, controller fetches teams and uses first one
  - **Why:** Simpler for MVP. Other experiences have full setup flow, Weekly can add later.
  - **Reversible:** Yes, can add team selector UI later
- Skip LLM summaries for now: Use placeholder/fallback per spec's MVP guidance
  - **Why:** User has Anthropic Max subscription but API key not configured yet
  - **Revisit:** When API key is configured
- Core loop first, NFL/LLM later: Prioritized matchup detail + standings + week nav
  - **Why:** User specified "core loop first, then NFL scores, then fantasy matchups"
  - **Result:** Core experience works, can layer in enhancements progressively

**Files created:**
- `backend/stats/weekly_analyzer.py`
- `frontend/weekly.html`
- `frontend/static/js/weeklyController.js`
- `frontend/static/js/weeklyRenderer.js`
- `frontend/static/js/lineupEditor.js` (stub)
- `frontend/static/css/weekly.css`

**Files modified:**
- `backend/app.py` (added `/api/league/<id>/week/<week>/deep-dive` endpoint, added `weekly.html` route)
- `frontend/index.html` (added Weekly Deep Dive option, updated grid to 2x2, added weekly icon/styles)
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated project structure, API endpoints, "When to Read What" table, Multi-Experience Architecture)

**Testing:**
- Verified API returns correct data for weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 (league 17810260, year 2025)
- Verified team lookup works (Will Hofner = team_id 1)
- Verified standings calculation through each week
- Verified lineup errors detection
- Frontend loads correctly (HTML served, no 404s)

**Next steps (when user resumes):**
1. Implement tap-to-swap lineup editor (Section 2A)
2. Add NFL scores (Section 4 — `nfl_data.py`)
3. Add projected points parsing to `espn_api.py`
4. Add LLM summary generation (Sections 1 & 2B) when API key configured
5. Make "All Matchups" cards expandable to show full rosters

### 2026-02-07 — Weekly Deep Dive Feature Ideation

- Ideated "Weekly Deep Dive" — a week-by-week season explorer, second product surface alongside Wrapped
- Inspired by fantasywrapped.com (EPL equivalent) — editorial magazine feel, week navigation
- Core sections: NFL summary, fantasy matchup detail, lineup editor, league summary, standings, NFL scores, all fantasy matchups
- Decided on Claude API for LLM-generated summaries (NFL weekly + fantasy league weekly)
- Decided on ESPN public NFL scoreboard API for real game scores
- Decided on magazine/editorial layout (dark theme, readable, not flashy)
- Decided on tap-to-swap lineup editing (not drag-and-drop)
- Decided this is a standalone page (`weekly.html`) accessible from hub after setup
- Generated spec: `spec-docs/001-weekly-deep-dive.md`
- Added to ROADMAP under "Now (Active Focus)"

**Key architecture decisions:**
- New backend modules: `nfl_data.py`, `weekly_analyzer.py`, `summary_generator.py`
- New API endpoints for weekly deep dive data, NFL scores, and LLM summaries
- Progressive loading: fast data first, LLM summaries load async last
- LLM summaries have placeholder fallback if API isn't ready

---

### 2026-02-07 — Workflow & Skills Overhaul

- Defined 5 workflow types: bug fix, feature ideation, feature building, senior review, stand-up
- Overhauled `/bug-report` skill → full flow: interview → investigate → report → offer fix → add to ROADMAP if deferred
- Created `/ideate` skill → feature interview → numbered spec doc in `spec-docs/` → update ROADMAP
- Created `/senior-review` skill → autonomous code quality audit, optional scope, commits its own fixes
- Created `/stand-up` skill → quick standup meeting, generates numbered doc in `stand-ups/`
- Created `spec-docs/` and `stand-ups/` directories
- Updated CLAUDE.md: project structure, skills table, When to Read What, meeting notes behavioral directive
- Established continuous changelog workflow — update MEETING_NOTES.md as we go, not end of session
- Created `/overnight` skill → interview for priorities → autonomous execution → numbered summary doc
- Created `overnight-summaries/` directory
- Migrated `SPRINT_SUMMARY.md` → `overnight-summaries/001-2026-02-02-card-pack-experience.md` (reformatted to new summary template)
- Deleted old `SPRINT_SUMMARY.md`

**Decisions:**
- Bug reports that aren't immediately fixed get added to ROADMAP under "Known Bugs"
- Spec docs numbered `001-feature-name.md`, standups numbered `001-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, overnight summaries numbered `001-YYYY-MM-DD-focus.md`
- Senior review runs fully autonomous (no user input needed)
- Overnight skill: interactive interview phase, then fully autonomous. Never asks questions after kickoff.
- Meeting notes = scannable bulleted changelog, not exhaustive action log

**Files created:**
- `.claude/skills/ideate/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/senior-review/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/stand-up/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/overnight/SKILL.md`
- `spec-docs/.gitkeep`
- `stand-ups/.gitkeep`
- `overnight-summaries/001-2026-02-02-card-pack-experience.md` (migrated from SPRINT_SUMMARY.md)

**Files modified:**
- `.claude/skills/bug-report/SKILL.md` (overhauled)
- `CLAUDE.md` (project structure, skills, workflow directives)
- `MEETING_NOTES.md` (this entry + format update)

**Files deleted:**
- `SPRINT_SUMMARY.md` (content migrated to overnight-summaries/)

- Ran first `/stand-up` → `stand-ups/001-2026-02-07.md`

---

### 2026-02-02 — Card Pack Experience Sprint

**What we discussed:**
- Project kickoff interview - clarified product vision and priorities
- Visual direction: dark/sleek theme, collectible card aesthetic
- Pack opening metaphor: Pokémon-style card reveals with rarity tiers
- Platform strategy: web-first but mobile-native design
- ESPN auth: prefer OAuth but accept public-only for now
- Multiple presentation modes: pack opening AND slideshow

**Decisions made:**
- Build pack opening as primary new experience (not replace slides)
- Dark theme with near-black backgrounds (#08080c base)
- 5 rarity tiers: Common → Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary
- Standard trading card ratio (2.5:3.5)
- Separate data transform layer (CardBuilder) from rendering
- Holographic/prismatic effects for legendary cards
- Mode toggle to switch between Pack and Slideshow experiences

**Implemented:**
- [x] Dark theme design system (theme-dark.css)
- [x] Card component with rarity effects (cards.css)
- [x] Pack opening animations (pack-opening.css)
- [x] Card builder - transforms API data to card objects (cardBuilder.js)
- [x] Card renderer - generates HTML from cards (cardRenderer.js)
- [x] Pack opening controller (packOpening.js)
- [x] Superlative guessing game (superlativeGame.js)
- [x] New frontend with mode toggle (index-v2.html)
- [x] Card system design documentation (docs/CARD_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)
- [x] Sprint summary (SPRINT_SUMMARY.md)

**Decided against:**
- Modifying original slideshow files (kept as separate mode)
- ESPN cookie/SWID auth (too janky, prefer public leagues for now)
- Sound effects (deferred - need user preference toggle)
- Pixelated/Game Boy style (went with sleek/premium instead)

**Questions for user:**
- Sound effects for pack opening?
- Card back design - generic or team-branded?
- Share/download individual cards?
- Superlative game mandatory or optional?

**Next steps:**
- Test with real league data in production
- Polish animations based on feel
- Add more superlatives
- Consider Madden UI exploration

**Files created this session:**
- `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
- `frontend/static/css/theme-dark.css`
- `frontend/static/css/cards.css`
- `frontend/static/css/pack-opening.css`
- `frontend/static/js/cardBuilder.js`
- `frontend/static/js/cardRenderer.js`
- `frontend/static/js/packOpening.js`
- `frontend/static/js/superlativeGame.js`
- `frontend/index-v2.html`
- `SPRINT_SUMMARY.md`

### 2026-02-02 — Project Documentation Setup

**What we discussed:**
- Establishing a meeting notes workflow to track decisions across sessions
- Creating a system for keeping documentation in sync after shipping code

**Decisions made:**
- Created MEETING_NOTES.md as the central log for conversations
- After each chat: Update meeting notes with decisions, implementations, and rejections
- After shipping code: Review and update CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, and MEETING_NOTES.md as needed

**Implemented:**
- [x] Created MEETING_NOTES.md
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with meeting notes workflow

**Decided against:**
- (None this session)

**Next steps:**
- Continue building features per ROADMAP.md priorities
