# Stand-Up 001 — 2026-02-07

## Recent Progress
_What we built or specced since last standup._

- **Skill suite shipped** — 6 skills total: `/bug-report` (overhauled), `/ideate`, `/senior-review`, `/stand-up`, `/overnight`, `/clean-slate`. Commit `ebf4adb`.
- **Workflow system defined** — 5 interaction modes (bug fix, ideate, senior review, stand-up, overnight) with clear handoffs and doc outputs.
- **Hub page + multi-experience architecture** — Shipped hub landing page with 4 experiences (slides, card pack, arcade, VR HUD). Commit `9d1f739`.
- **Bug fixes** — Fixed API URL mismatch and hidden arcade errors. Commit `f2dd510`.
- **Card pack experience** — Full collectible card opening with 5 rarity tiers, holographic effects, superlative guessing game. Shipped 2026-02-02.
- **Project infrastructure** — New folders: `spec-docs/`, `stand-ups/`, `overnight-summaries/`. Continuous changelog workflow established.

## Open Questions
_Things I need your input on before moving forward._

1. **Card pack testing** — The card pack hasn't been tested with real league data in production yet. This is the #1 item in ROADMAP "Now" section. Have you had a chance to test it? Any bugs to report?
2. **Existing bug reports** — There are 2 bug reports in `bug-reports/` (`001-api-url-mismatch.md`, `002-arcade-hidden-errors.md`). The API URL fix was committed (`f2dd510`) — are these fully resolved, or still lingering issues?
3. **Sound effects** — Deferred from the card pack sprint. Still on your radar, or push it further down?
4. **Unanswered card pack questions** — From the original sprint: card back design (generic vs team-branded)? Share/download individual cards? Superlative game mandatory or optional?

## Current State
_Where things stand right now._

- **In progress:** Nothing actively in progress — just shipped the workflow overhaul
- **Blocked on:** Card pack real-data testing (needs you to test with a real league)
- **Ready to build:** All P0 roadmap items are well-defined and ready for implementation:
  - League-Wide Superlatives System
  - Luckiest Win / Heartbreaking Loss slides
  - Week-by-Week Error Chart
  - FLEX Analysis Slide

## Proposed Next Steps
_What I recommend we tackle next, in priority order._

1. **Test card pack with real league data** — This is the biggest unknown. We shipped a lot of UI code but haven't validated it against real ESPN data. Bugs here could cascade.
2. **League-Wide Superlatives System** — P0 in roadmap. Every manager gets an award. Instant group chat fuel. Most of the data already exists — this is high ROI.
3. **Luckiest Win / Heartbreaking Loss** — P0. Emotional hooks from matchup data we already have. Quick to calculate, highly shareable.
4. **Run `/senior-review`** — We've shipped a lot of code across multiple sessions. A quality pass would catch bugs before they compound. Good candidate for an overnight session.

## Notes
- The ROADMAP still lists "Pokemon Card Flip UX" under P2 even though it's marked done — it was completed as part of the Card Pack Experience. Minor cleanup.
- No spec docs have been created yet — the `/ideate` skill is ready for first use whenever we want to explore a feature.
- The overnight workflow is set up and ready. Could be a good way to tackle the P0 superlatives system + a senior review in one session.
