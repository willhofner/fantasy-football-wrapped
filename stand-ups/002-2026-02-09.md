# Stand-Up 002 — 2026-02-09

## Recent Progress
_What we built or specced since last standup._

- **Test Skill Created** — Added `/test` skill for end-to-end QA validation with real data. Generates numbered test reports. ([`.claude/skills/test/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/test/SKILL.md))
- **Skill Usage Guidelines** — Added comprehensive "When to Use Each Skill" section to CLAUDE.md with situation guide, workflow chains, and usage rules
- **Overnight Skill Updated** — Modified `/overnight` to recommend `/test` after shipping frontend code
- **Deployment Infrastructure** — Deployed to production at wrapped.football (Railway hosting, auto-deploy from GitHub)

## Open Questions
_Things I need your input on before moving forward._

1. **Should we fix the bugs before continuing with new features?** — We have 2 documented bugs that completely break the experiences (API URL mismatch + arcade error swallowing). Both are understood and fixable. Do we fix these before testing Weekly Deep Dive, or test Weekly first?

2. **Test priority: Full regression or just Weekly Deep Dive?** — You mentioned wanting to run `/test` on Weekly Deep Dive. Should we:
   - Test only Weekly Deep Dive (focused, faster)
   - Test all 4 experiences (comprehensive, catches regressions)
   - Fix bugs first, then test everything

3. **Senior review scope?** — You mentioned wanting `/senior-review`. Should it:
   - Review everything (full codebase)
   - Focus on recently shipped code (Weekly Deep Dive + test skill)
   - Focus on specific areas (backend stats modules, frontend controllers, etc.)

## Current State
_Where things stand right now._

- **In progress:** Nothing actively being worked on (awaiting your direction)
- **Blocked on:** Your decision on bug fixes vs testing priority
- **Ready to build:**
  - Bug fixes (both bugs fully documented with suggested fixes)
  - Weekly Deep Dive enhancements (lineup editor, NFL scores, LLM summaries)
  - Any feature from ROADMAP "Now" or "Next" sections
- **Known bugs:**
  - [Bug 001](../bug-reports/001-api-url-mismatch.md) — API calls hit wrong server (CRITICAL, affects all experiences)
  - [Bug 002](../bug-reports/002-arcade-hidden-errors.md) — Arcade swallows errors silently (HIGH)

## Proposed Next Steps
_What I recommend we tackle next, in priority order._

1. **Fix critical bugs (30 min)** — Both bugs are well-understood. Bug 001 breaks everything, Bug 002 makes debugging impossible. Fix these first so `/test` runs work properly.
   - Add Flask routes for all HTML pages (fixes 001)
   - Update `showError()` to toggle visibility + remove inline styles from arcade (fixes 002)

2. **Run `/test` on full app (45 min)** — Now that we have the test skill and bugs are fixed, validate all 4 experiences work end-to-end. Generate first test report.
   - Test hub page + all 4 experiences (slideshow, card pack, arcade, weekly)
   - Use league 17810260, year 2025, team Will
   - Document any new bugs found

3. **Run `/senior-review` on recent code (1-2 hrs)** — Get a second pass on code quality, catch any issues the test skill misses.
   - Focus on recently shipped Weekly Deep Dive code + test skill
   - Let it find optimizations, missing error handling, dead code

4. **Weekly Deep Dive enhancements** — After validation and review, continue building out deferred features from [spec 001](../spec-docs/001-weekly-deep-dive.md):
   - Tap-to-swap lineup editor
   - NFL scores integration
   - LLM summaries (when API key ready)

## Notes

**Why fix bugs first:**
- Bug 001 means NO experience works right now (all API calls fail)
- Testing a broken app isn't useful — we'd be testing the bugs, not the features
- Both bugs have clear fixes, low risk, high impact

**Why test before building new features:**
- Weekly Deep Dive is completely untested in a real browser (only API validation done)
- Test skill is brand new and should be exercised
- Catches integration issues we missed during overnight session

**Project health:**
- Clean git status (no uncommitted work)
- Good documentation coverage (CLAUDE.md, spec docs, bug reports all up to date)
- Clear roadmap with prioritized features
- Skill suite is mature and working well
